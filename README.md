# What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer segmentation is a crucial marketing strategy that involves dividing a company's customer base into distinct groups based on specific characteristics or behaviors. These groups, known as customer segments, share similar traits, preferences, or needs. By analyzing and understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, product offerings, and customer experiences to better meet the unique requirements of each group.

Customer segmentation is achieved through data analysis, leveraging various data sources like customer demographics, purchase history, browsing behavior, and feedback. Advanced machine learning algorithms play a vital role in automating this process, ensuring accurate and efficient identification of relevant customer segments.
